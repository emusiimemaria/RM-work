\section{METHODOLOGY}
\paragraph{Among the methods includes the following:the normal equationa.}
\paragraph{Given data $((x1; y1).......(xN; yN))$, we may define the error associated to saying y = ax + b.}
\paragraph{This is just N times the variance of the data set and It makes no difference whether or not we study the variance or N times the variance as our error, and note that the error is a function of two variables.}
\paragraph{The goal is to find values of a and b that minimize the error.We will describe how to factor a general m × n matrix A, with m ≥ n,A = QˆR.}
	\begin{equation}
a^2y-(ax+b)=1/N\sum_{N}^{n=1}){(yn ¡ (axn + b^2))}.
	\end{equation}
