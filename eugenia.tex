\section{OBJECTIVES}
\subsection{Main objective}
\begin{itemize}
    \item To solve the least squares using QR factorization.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Specific Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
    \item To turn the columns of the matrix into the orthogonal set via Gram-Schmidt. \\
    \item To turn the orthogonal set into an orthonormal set by dividing the columns in the orthogonal set by their lengths which is Q.\\
    \item To find the upper triangle matrix by finding the product of the transpose of the orthonormal set and the matrix which is R.\\
    \item To find the QR factorization by finding the product of the orthonormal set and the upper triangle matrix.\\
\end{itemize}
